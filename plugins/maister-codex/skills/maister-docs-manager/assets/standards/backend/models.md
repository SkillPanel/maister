## Models

### Clear Naming
Use singular names for models and plural for tables (or follow framework conventions).

### Timestamps
Include created and updated timestamps for auditing and debugging.

### Database Constraints
Enforce data rules at the database level (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys).

### Appropriate Types
Choose data types that match purpose and size requirements.

### Index Foreign Keys
Index foreign key columns and frequently queried fields.

### Multi-Layer Validation
Validate at both model and database levels for defense in depth.

### Clear Relationships
Define relationships with appropriate cascade behaviors and naming.

### Practical Normalization
Balance normalization with query performance needs.
